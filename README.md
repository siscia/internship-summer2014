# Why

I made this document because as student I find hard to find company where to apply for a summer internship.

The best resource I got untill now is the [AskHN: Who is hiring][ask-hn] post, and the websites of big companies.

I would like to collect contact from small to medium company or startup that are looking for hiring interns.

# How be listen

I will also check for pull request on this document.

### Note

For anti-spam reason email address such `john@gmail.com` will appear as `john (at) gmail (dot) com` .

If I get a lot of submision I will make something more structured, for now a markdown page is good enough.

internship-summer2014
=====================

# Why

I made this document because as student I find hard to find company where to apply for a summer internship.

The best resource I got untill now is the [AskHN: Who is hiring][ask-hn] post, and the websites of big companies.

I would like to collect contact from small to medium company or startup that are looking for hiring interns.
